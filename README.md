# Altan 

Altan UI is a comprehensive framework for AI agents to seamlessly integrate backend logic into user interfaces and build them using pre-existing components. The framework consolidates three main modules:

- **Databases**: Tools to integrate backend databases with Redux and Axios.
- **Components**: A library of reusable UI components for rapid development.
- **Blocks**: Pre-built UI blocks that can be assembled to create complex interfaces.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Configure and use modules for databases, UI components, and layout blocks in one unified package.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily customize API endpoints and table configurations to suit your unique backend.
- **Integrated State Management**: Leverage Redux with built-in reducers and providers for seamless state handling.
- **Rapid UI Assembly**: Utilize pre-designed components and blocks to quickly construct fully functional UIs.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Altan UI**

   ```bash
   npm install altan
   ```

2. **Configure the Database Module**

   Before using the database functionality, set your API endpoint and table identifiers:

   ```ts
   import { setDatabaseConfig } from "altan";

   setDatabaseConfig({
     API_BASE_URL: "https://api.altan.ai/galaxia/hook/2o6RF5",
     SAMPLE_TABLES: {
       your_table: "YOUR_TABLE_ID",
       your_table2: "YOUR_TABLE_ID2"
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Wrap Your App with the Database Provider**

   To integrate Redux state management for your databases, wrap your application with the `DatabaseProvider`:

   ```tsx
   import React from "react";
   import { DatabaseProvider } from "altan";

   const App = () => (
     <DatabaseProvider>
       {/* Your application components */}
     </DatabaseProvider>
   );

   export default App;
   ```

4. **Use Components and Blocks**

   Import and use UI components and blocks from Altan UI as needed:

   ```tsx
   import { SomeComponent, SomeBlock } from "altan";

   // Use SomeComponent and SomeBlock in your UI
   ```

## Modules Overview

### Databases

- **Configuration**: Set your API base URL and table identifiers using `setDatabaseConfig`.
- **Redux Integration**: Pre-configured Redux slice and provider manage backend data and state.
- **Data Fetching**: Async thunks for CRUD operations to interact with your backend.

### Components

- A collection of reusable UI components designed for rapid interface development.

### Blocks

- Pre-designed UI blocks that help you assemble complex UIs quickly and efficiently.

## Documentation

The complete API reference is available within the code. Detailed usage examples and further documentation for each module (databases, components, blocks) are provided inline.
